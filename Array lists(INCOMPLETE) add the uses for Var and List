		//I put the numbers at the start just so you can see hoe .sort() works later
		
		//To find the length of this ArrayList, you don't use the .length method. You use .size() . 
		
		//You can also remove things. You need the specific index for this
		Monkeys.remove(4);//This removes the Firework monkey. I do not condone animal abuse.

		//Or add things with a specific index
		Monkeys.add(4, "6 Mel");
		
		//To access an element in the array, all you need is the index
		Monkeys.get(4);//This will give you Mel, but will not print it out

		//To change values to another value, you need the index again
		Monkeys.set(4, "6 Norbert");//He's an idiot(I'm so funny trust. everybody gets this reference)

		//You can also clear the list by doing .clear(); but I wont do that. I like my monkeys.
		//It is important to remember that ArrayLists keep things in the exact order you add them in unless you use the .sort() method
		
		//To use the .sort() method, you have to put it at the end (mind blown ik)
		Collections.sort(Monkeys);//for Strings, then it will sort by Ascii value, but for numericals it will sort with ascending order
		
		//Time to loop through this thing. You have the for each loop and the normal one. The F.E one actually makes sense since you don't need 2 like for 2D arrays
		
		//For-Each
		out.println("This is a for each: ");

		}

		//There are also 2 other ways to write these things. I don't exactly know the pros and the cons, but here they are: 
		
		//You can use List. This one has pros apparently, but idk man
		List <Integer> Braincells= new ArrayList();//Oh yeah, it is also important that you use the wrapper class versions or it wont compile and you will blow up
		
		//There is also Var. I am getting javascript nightmares
		var debt = new ArrayList();//for this, you dont have to define what it is. the only good thing about javascript lol
		
		//summary paragraph yippee(imma start this, it is a gud idea)
		out.println("An ArrayList is just a cool array that can be modified.\nIt can grow, shrink, clear itself and use the for each loop without making you combust.\nYou use .get() to get a vaule, .set() to set a value, .size() for the length, and .add() or .remove to add and remove from this thing");
